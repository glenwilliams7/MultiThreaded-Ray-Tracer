# MultiThreaded-Ray-Tracer
Multi-threaded version of basic ray tracer based on youtube tutorial at https://youtu.be/k_aRiYSXcyo

It adds support for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 core CPU's. I may or may not create a youtube video on how to convert Celeb's raytracer to this.

This code was written in Visual Studio 2017 with the windows SDK and pretty much everything else installed. The generated image is saved as a *.bmp inside the same folder the code is in.
